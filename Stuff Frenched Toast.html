    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <p>I came up with this recipe one morning while preparing breakfast for guests at my bed and breakfast.
             It became one of our most requested dishes and I later included it in our inn's cookbook!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="section">
         <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup raspberry puree</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1 inch slices</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        <li>nutmeg, for topping</li>
        
         </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon into the beaten eggs until well blended. 
            Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together raspberry puree and cream cheese until smooth.
             Make 'sandwiches' by cutting each slice of bread in half and spreading raspberry-cheese mixture in the center, 
             then top with the other half.</li>
             <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg mixture, coating thoroughly. 
                 Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and nutmeg.
                  Serve immediately.</li>
