        <p>Imagine the best French toast you've ever had, 
            combined with the best ham and cheese sandwich you've ever had,

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
             <li>Whisk 2 eggs, cream, white sugar, salt, 1 pinch cayenne pepper, cinnamon,
             and allspice together in a bowl until batter is thoroughly combined.</li>
             <li>Lay bread slices into batter, one at a time, and let bread absorb the mixture. 
                 Turn bread slices in batter until almost all batter has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
                 <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and melt butter in the hot skillet. 
                     Cook bread slices in the hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. 
                     Transfer French toast slices to a baking sheet.</li>
                     <li>Lay ham slices into the hot skillet and cook until meat begins to brown, 
                         about 1 minute per side.</li>
                         <li>To assemble, place a Cheddar cheese slice on a slice of French toast, top with 2 slices of ham, 
                             and lay a Havarti cheese slice over ham.</li>
                             <li>Bake in the preheated oven until French toast pieces are no longer wet, the batter is set, 
                                 and cheese has melted and begun to brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
                                 <li>Place sandwiches on serving plates and top each with 2 poached eggs.
                                      Season with kosher salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
